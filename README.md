# Khushi: A Modern RAG Application (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Khushi is a state-of-the-art RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application that integrates a Flutter frontend, FastAPI backend, and utilizes the OpenAI and LangChain frameworks for intelligent text retrieval and generation.

---

## üõ§Ô∏è Roadmap (5 Phases)

### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Initial Integration**
- [ ] Set up project repositories for Flutter (frontend) and FastAPI (backend)
- [ ] Establish version control and standard branching
- [ ] Scaffold the Flutter app (basic UI and navigation)
- [ ] Scaffold the FastAPI backend (basic API endpoints)
- [ ] Integrate OpenAI API keys and test basic query/response
- [ ] Research LangChain Python integration

### **Phase 2: Core RAG Architecture**
- Design database schema for knowledge/document storage
- Implement document ingestion pipeline (FastAPI & LangChain)
- Integrate LangChain retrieval and chunking
- Implement vector store (FAISS/Chroma/etc.)
- Build API endpoints for document retrieval & search
- Flutter UI for uploading/viewing documents

### **Phase 3: Intelligent Query and Generation**
- Design intuitive search/input UI in Flutter
- Implement API for semantic search (using LangChain)
- Integrate OpenAI for contextual generation
- Build chat-like interface
- User session management

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features & Optimization**
- Add user authentication/authorization
- Advanced analytics & usage monitoring
- API rate limiter/quota (FastAPI middleware)
- Improve embeddings via fine-tuning (OpenAI/LangChain)
- Optimize Flutter UI/UX for performance
- Testing (unit, integration, E2E)

### **Phase 5: Deployment & Maintenance**
- Deploy FastAPI backend (Docker/Azure/AWS/etc.)
- Deploy Flutter app (Web, Android, iOS)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring & logging
- Documentation & demo video
- Gather feedback & iterate

### üì¶ Tech Stack
- **Flutter** (Frontend/mobile/web)
- **FastAPI** (Python Backend)
- **OpenAI GPT/Embeddings** (NLP)
- **LangChain** (Python RAG Framework)
- **Vector DB** (FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone, etc.)

---

### üöÄ Getting Started
1. Clone both the Flutter and FastAPI repos
2. Set up environment variables for OpenAI
3. Run FastAPI server locally
4. Launch Flutter app on your device or web browser
5. Start uploading and querying your documents!
